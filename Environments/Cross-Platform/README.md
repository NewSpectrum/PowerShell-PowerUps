# Multi-System Environment

This very likely will not be a __*Docker*__ Dev Container, if it ends up being a *Dev Container* at all. There's a very good chance the only way this will run as smoothly as I intend is by hosting it from a legitimate virtual server.

Time will tell.

But probably not soon.
