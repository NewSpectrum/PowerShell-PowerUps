When you saw this, did you think there was some kind of virtual, potentially remote dev environment for MacOS that didn't require *already* working on a Mac?

Sorry. No such luck.

Maybe some day...

# On a Serious Note

Once __*any*__ kind of development environment for __MacOS__ becomes available to me, I will be creating an environment configuration, similar to the __Docker Dev Containers__ in the __Linux__ and __Windows__ Environment folders.
