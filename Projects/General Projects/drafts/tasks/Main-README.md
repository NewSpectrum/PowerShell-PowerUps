# Repository Readme (Basics)

The __[PowerShell-Powerups](https://github.com/NewSpectrum/PowerShell-PowerUps)__ repository's __[Primary README](https://github.com/NewSpectrum/PowerShell-PowerUps/blob/main/README.md)__, and essentially its *homepage*, still have yet to be composed.

The key word there is *composed*, because a README- especially the repository's primary, is as much a work-in-progress as the repository itself. As things develop, the README (and all relevant documentation), will be updated accordingly. That said, when the time comes for these updates, additional tasks will be drafted.

For now, the requirements are few and relatively simple, listed below. If you're a new contributor, please be sure to review the __[Documentation Guidelines](text)__ before you put time into something that turns out to be... not quite right.

## Requirements
- [ ] Introduction & Summary
	- [ ] Purposes of __[PowerShell-Powerups](https://github.com/NewSpectrum/PowerShell-PowerUps)__
	- [ ] Intended Goals
- [ ] Reference to the __[Repository Wiki](https://github.com/NewSpectrum/PowerShell-PowerUps/Wiki__

## Documentation Checklist
- [ ] Add __[Reference Links]__ to *anything* and __*everything*__ you can
	- __*Especially*__ when referencing anything in this repository or from __New Spectrum__ in general.
	- Think about how __[Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/)__ links/references everything,
		- Also pay attention to how *this* __README/comment__ is composed, as well as other __[New Spectrum Documentation]__.
- [ ] Check the __[Mobile-View]__
	- [ ] __IMPORTANT:__ Ensure Headers stay on a __*single-line*__
		- Writing on a nice desktop makes it very easy for an `h1` title to span *2-3 lines* in mobile browsers
			- __Tip:__ You can emulate mobile devices using your desktop browser's __[Developer Tools]__ (`F12`)
	- [ ] Make sure images (if any) render properly in both views
		- [ ] Verify images are inserted with the __[HTML `img` Tags]__, *not* the `![...]()` __[Markdown Syntax]__
			- Should you run into issues with image formatting, refer to the documentation on __[Image Placement]__, or feel free to ask for help.
	

### Added Bonuses
- [ ] Add the PowerShell 7 Logo
	- aka: The __PowerShell Core 6.0__ Logo
	- File Path: `~/Projects/.assets/icons/Official PS Core 6.0.svg`
- [ ] Add OS Logos if/where appropriate.
