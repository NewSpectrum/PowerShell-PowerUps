.SYNOPSIS
	Set Escape-Sequence Variables

.DESCRIPTION
	Sets a series of PSCustomObjects that can be called on in Cmdlets such as 'Write-Host' as an easy-to-use text formatting system.

NOTES
	Extra Details.

.EXAMPLE
	Example 1:
	Get the Parameters of 'Get-ChildItem'
	
	Command Line Input:
		Get-Params 'Get-ChildItem'
	
	[ Full simulated output for this example is online-only ]

.EXAMPLE 
	Example 2:
	Pipe 'Get-Command' output to 'Get-Params'
	
	Command Line Input:
		Get-Command -Verb 'Set' -Noun 'Var*' -CommandType -Cmdlet | Get-Params
	
	
	The output of the 'Get-Command' portion alone would be:
	
		CommandType     Name                Version    Source
		-----------     ----                -------    ------    
		Cmdlet          Set-Variable        7.0.0.0    Microsofâ€¦
	
	
	Because there is only ONE result, the output can be piped '|' into the 'Get-Params' function.
	
	[ Full simulated output for this example is online-only ]
